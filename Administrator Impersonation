Alert Description:
This alert triggers when a user who does not have administrative privileges tries to gain access by impersonating an administrator, which could indicate malicious intent, compromised credentials, or internal threats.

Details need to capture during investigation.
1. Username, user ID, and associated roles/permissions.
2. Account status (active, disabled, locked).
3. Authentication methods used (e.g., password, MFA).
4. Location (IP address and geolocation) and device used for the attempt.
5. Resources or services the user tried to access (including Source Asset & Destination Asset)
6. Check for any failed logins for the source user and the administrator account before the Administrator impersonation event, to see if any brute force is attempted on these accounts.
7. Review associated security logs, including login, access, and system logs.
8. Check for any preceding suspicious activities (failed logins, password resets).

Containment Eradiction and Recovery:
1. Immediately suspend or restrict the non-administrator account involved.
2. Block any suspicious IP addresses or devices associated with the attempt.
3. Reset passwords and enforce stronger authentication mechanisms for sensitive accounts.
4. Review and adjust user permissions to ensure least-privilege access.

Best Practices:
1. Implement least privilege access and regularly review user roles and permissions.
2. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts.
3. Set up alerts for any unusual authentication attempts or privilege escalation activities.
